# BasicNodeApi
Node basic api that shows some basic concepts of NodeJs :)

# How does it Works?
This is a simple API that shows some basic features of NodeJs.
Here it will be possible to make a Crud of a project on Json on the folowing Json structure:

{
	"id": "",
	"title": "",
	"tasks":[""]
}

To make the tests easier there a .json with all endpoints that you can use to test this API.

Obs: this API uses some midlewares for count requisitions on console and validate Ids when they are used on Params of a requistions.

Thank you :)
